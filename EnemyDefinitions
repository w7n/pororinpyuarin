Enemy Name (ID, Element) 
Class 0 - Platforming Type, Platforming Trend, Movement Speed, Jump Height, Traits, Alt. Attack Option, Death State, Coefficient Type 
Class 1 - " "
Coefficient - Describe if Special, or N/A
U (All Classes) - Universal Traits (i.e. If Standing, N, If Shell, M)

ELEMENTS:
N = Normal
H = Harmful when stomped onto, otherwise normal
F = Fiery (Hit by fire = Lv+1, prone to ice; Normally can not be stomped onto)
I = Ice (Hit by ice = Lv+1, prone to fire)
M = Metal (Immune to Stomp Damage, Only prone to gunner & hammer)
S = Spiritual (only prone to Mage Mario; Normally can not be stomped onto)
U = Undefeatable except with Cross, or Starman if it does have a bounding box
NE = Not enemy, and thus undefeatable and cannot harm you either. 
This should only be taken literally: The object ITSELF might not be an enemy, but it may generate an enemy.

PLATFORMING TYPE: Regular (R), Irregular (I)
PLATFORMING TREND (N/A if Irregular): Normal (N), Hopper (H = Hops around), Skipper (S =Jumps over chasm), Hunter (K = Pursues)
MOVEMENT SPEED (X if TREND is K): Slow (S), Normal (N), Fast (F), Very Fast (V)
JUMP HEIGHT (Based on 16x16 Block Stacks): N/A (X), 1, 2, 3, 4, Random (R (Min # - Max #))
TRAITS: Describe if Platforming Type is Irregular, or N/A (X)
ALT. ATTACK OPTION: Transform (T, (Timer in Seconds), (ID, Class)), Describe if need be, or N/A (X)
DEATH STATE: Die (D), Transform (T (ID, Class))
COEFFICIENT TYPE: Normal Coefficient (N), Special Coefficient (S, describe below)
