Who knows what this is...

PLEASE READ THE GUIDELINES FIRST.

Area types:

0 - Completely underwater, no unique blocks

1 - Normal w/slopes and terrain of multiple palettes

2 - Normal w/breakable terrain (i.e. Super Fire can break these terrain blocks and reveal paths, otherwise Super Fire can only break bricks)

3 - Normal w/slopes and some other unique blocks

Area types <=3 use complex terrain (all sides). Types below use simple terrain (only unique for up&down)

4 - Normal w/more switch-dependant blocks and possibly MANY more slope blocks

5 - Normal w/cannons & other enemy generators (only in this type will cannons be checked whilst refreshing level data)

6 - Normal w/time-dependant blocks, or blocks related to the Rhizome routine (e.g. destructing blocks in Luigi no Nazo)

7 - BG oriented, only for aesthetics, while only the most basic objects are used.

NOTE:
Switch-dependant blocks (EMB's ! blocks etc.) can be used in all areas except AT6 & AT7, but only AT4 can have 3 switches at the same time.
