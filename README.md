Who knows what this is...

Area types:
0 - Completely underwater, no unique blocks
1 - Normal w/slopes
2 - Normal w/breakable terrain (i.e. Super Fire can break these terrain blocks and reveal paths, otherwise Super Fire can only break bricks)
3 - (Undecided)
Area types <=3 use complex terrain (all sides). Types below use simple terrain (only unique for up&down)
4 - Normal w/more unique blocks (WHICH? EMB's ! blocks maybe?)
5 - Normal w/cannons (only in this type will cannons be checked whilst refreshing level data)
6 - Slippery & conveyer belt blocks
7 - BG oriented, only for aesthetics, while only the most basic objects are used.
